<h1>Volunteering at the<br> Waterford Public Library</h1><img src="https://librarytechnology.org/photos-libraries/6944.jpg"/><br>By Lorelei Peck<br>
<font color=#e5e7e9 <h2>The Waterford Library can always <br>use more volunteers for their summer reading program!<br>
Volunteering is a great and fun way to help the community!<br>
When you volunteer, you can either: <br>
</font><ul><li>Help with one of their many programs</li><li>Help more people sign up for the summer reading program</li><li>or help little kids with their projects!</li></ul>
<p><font-family=Courier>It's also a great way to meet new friends!</font-family></p> <br>
<a href="https://www.waterford.lib.wi.us/">Here is a link to the Library website!</a><br>
At that website, you can see some of the many programs coming up!<br><br>
To sign up for volunteering, you can go to the library<br>and talk to either the front desk or the teen librarian!<br>

<em>There has been library service in Waterford, Wisconsin since the 1920â€²s.<br> Over the years, the library moved its location three times and offered a rotating collection of books provided by the Racine Public Library.<br> In 1965 the village appointed a library board and in 1967 the library set up shop in half of the Waterford Village Hall.<br> The library provided service from that location for 34 years, at which time it became necessary<br> to move to improve the level of service to residents. The Waterford Public Library opened for business in its spacious<br> new location at 101 N. River Street on March 12, 2001</em>
